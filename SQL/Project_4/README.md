This project analyzes whether international NBA players tend to be **taller and heavier** than players from the USA and Canada.

## 📌 Objective
To compare the **average height and weight** of NBA players from:
- 🇺🇸 USA / 🇨🇦 Canada
- 🌍 International countries

…based on each player's **rookie season**, ensuring players are only counted once.

## 🧠 Methodology
- Used season-level NBA player data spanning **20+ seasons**
- Isolated the **first available season** for each player using a `MIN(season)` approach
- Grouped players into two categories based on `country`
- Calculated average `player_height` and `player_weight` per group

## 🛠️ Tools
- SQL (CTE + JOIN logic)
