# 🏀 NBA Career Longevity Analysis by Debut Age

This project combines sports analytics and SQL to explore how the **age at which NBA players debut** correlates with the **length of their professional careers**.

---

## 📌 Objective
To determine whether players who debut at a younger age tend to have longer careers, using real NBA player data spanning **20+ seasons**.

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Steps
- Extracted each player's **debut season** from the dataset  
- Captured their **age at debut**  
- Calculated the **number of seasons played** for each player  
- Grouped results by debut age and computed **average career length**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **SQL (Common Table Expressions)** – for structured and readable querying  
- **Data Cleaning** – handled missing values and inconsistencies  
- **Visualization** – created a dark-themed visual package including:  
  - SQL query visualization  
  - Result table (debut age vs avg. career length)  
  - NBA-themed summary chart

---

## 📈 Key Insight
Players who debut at **19 years old** have the **longest average careers** (~8 seasons). While younger players generally last longer, **players debuting at 22** also perform surprisingly well. After age 25, career length **declines significantly**.
